## Introduction  
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict housing prices in California. Using demographic and geographic data from the dataset, the project aims to provide insights into how different features (e.g., median income, latitude, and longitude) affect housing prices.  

## Project Overview  
This project covers the following aspects:  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations.  
- Feature engineering to improve model performance.  
- Training and evaluating a linear regression model.  
- Visualizing the relationship between actual and predicted values.  

## Tools and Libraries  
The following tools and Python libraries were used:  
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code and documentation.  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.  
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model training and evaluation.  

## Dataset  
The dataset contains information on California housing prices, including features such as:  
- Median Income  
- Median House Value  
- Latitude and Longitude  
- Population  
- Total Rooms and Bedrooms  

Source: [California Housing Dataset from Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset).  

## Implementation  
### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values in the dataset.  
- Scaled numerical features for better model performance.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized feature distributions using histograms.  
- Analyzed correlations between features and the target variable (Median House Value).  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- Focused on key features like Median Income, Latitude, and Longitude.  
- Removed irrelevant or redundant features to optimize the model.  

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation  
- Trained a linear regression model.  
- Evaluated performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).  

### 5. Visualization  
- Created scatter plots to visualize predicted vs. actual housing prices.  

## Results  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: [Insert your MSE result here, e.g., 0.64]  
- **R-squared (R²)**: [Insert your R² result here, e.g., 0.51]  
- The model demonstrates reasonable predictive accuracy but can be improved further.  

### Key Visualization

*A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted house prices shows the model's predictive trends.*  

## Key Insights  
- **Median Income** was the most significant feature affecting housing prices.  
- Geographic features (latitude and longitude) contributed to regional price variations.
